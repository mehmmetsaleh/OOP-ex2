README - this file.

SpaceShip.java - an abstract class describing a basic type ship.

SpaceShipFactory.java - a Factory class for the purpose of instantiating 
			different types of ships according to the command-line
		        arguments.

HumanShip.java - a subclass of SpaceShip, which represents a ship controlled by
		 the user.

RunnerShip.java - a subclass of SpaceShip, Which represents a Runner ship.

BasherShip.java - a subclass of SpaceShip, Which represents a Basher ship.

AggressiveShip.java - a subclass of SpaceShip, Which represents an Aggressive ship.

DrunkardShip.java - a subclass of SpaceShip, Which represents a ship being driven by a
		    drunk person.
SpecialShip.java - a subclass of SpaceShip, Which represents a special-edition of an
		   undisputed ship in terms of attacking and hunting its enemy.


=============================
=          Design           =
=============================
I used the is-a relation (inheritance) between the SpaceShip class and 
the other specific-typed spaceShips (e.g HumanShip,RunnerShip,BasherShip, etc..)
In addition to that I declared the SpaceShip class to be Abstract, so that nobody
can instantiate it with a basic type of ship, because a ship must be type-specific.

I also used the has-a relation (composition) in the SpaceShip class, because each
spaceship is attached to a SpaceShipPhysics object once the ship is created.

Design advantages: the chosen design reflects the relationship between differnet classes
in a natural way, a HumanShip is a type of SpaceShip, and a SpaceShip has a location and
direction (physics object).

Design disadvantages: I had to use protected modifier in some of the data members of the 
SpaceShip class so that they're accessible by the subclasses. and this expands our API
unintentionally.
=============================
=  Implementation details   =
=============================
Each specific type of ship overrides the doAction() method from the SpaceShip class,
because each specific ship has its own unique action to do.

=============================
=    Drunkard Ship          =
=============================
The driver of this ship must've been drinking so much lately because his girlfriend
dumped him and he is in a pathetic situation even that he's driving while leaning his
head on the ship's dashboard and cries, but while he does that he also mistakenly stears
the wheel right and left (the whole time) and sometimes he accelerates, other times not.
while all that is happening he still feels anger over his breakup and that drives him to
shoot all over the space. that's truely unresponsible actions!

=============================
=    Special Ship           =
=============================
This is the kind of ship that wins wars. it has full energy the whole time
(both current and Max energies) and the energy generator is 10 times faster than
other ships.
One interesting thing about it, that once it's on the battle ground it sets an eye on the closest
ship and hunts it the whole war, until it destroys it and once again does the same thing to it.
it shows no mercy. while hunting the other ship it has it's gun on (with unlimited ammo) and also 
the shield is always up.
